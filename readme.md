# Large and Heavily Armored Warships

LaHAW is a remake of the classical "Battleship" game. Battleship is a turn based guessing game situated on an grid based ocean space. The game is separated into two parts: an introductory preparation state, where both of the players places their ships on their own ocean grid; and the game state, where the players takes turn in guessing where the opposing player has placed his or her ships. A correct guess is effectively noted as a 'hit'. Depending on the size of the ship, several hits might be necessary to sink the ship. The game ends after a player has hit and sunk all of the opposing player's ships.
