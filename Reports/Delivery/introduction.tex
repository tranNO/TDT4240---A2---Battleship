\chapter{Introduction}

This document describes the implementation of the Large and Heavily Armored Warships for Android game (LaHAW). The document details the differences between the planned architecture and the actual implementation. The document will first describe the finished system and its components and architecture. Then follows an analysis of the differences if any, and the reasoning behind the choices we made. We will also document what we've learned from the project, and our experiences.

\section{Background}
LaHAW has been developed as a part of Group A2's project in the course TDT4240 - Software architecture. The goal of this project is to develop a software architecture and an implementation of a game using the Android framework, with focus on a specific quality attribute like availability, testability or modifiability.
