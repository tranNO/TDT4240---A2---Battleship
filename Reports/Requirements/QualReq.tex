%• Quality Requirements: Write at least one scenario for the most relevant quality
%attributes (e.g. modifiability, testability, availability etc.). Use (textual/table)
%scenarios of the type used in chapter 4 of the book. Remember to make them
%measurable/testable by a concrete limit, or by, in some circumstances, a simple
%true/false evaluation. Set hard time limits, even if you are not fully aware of what is
%realistic. Avoid phrases like “reasonable time”. And create something nice, table
%like to write them in, remember... readability. (I repeat, do not write them in the
%horribly spacious figures of the inside cover of the book).
\chapter{Quality Requirements}
Below we will detail the two main quality attributes for the application: \emph{modifiability} that was mandatory for the application; and \emph{usability} that we chose for ourselves.

% Modifiability

\section{Modifiability}
Modifiability in an architectural sense is concerned about the cost of changeÂ \cite{pensum}. Our main approach is mainly concerned with changes made in \emph{design time}\footnote{Design time is conserned with measures and initiatives that is being implemented as the application is being designed. Even though everythign leading up the moment of delivery is in a broad sense design time, most of the initiatives should be implemented in the desing phase of the project. This is opposed to \emph{run time}, which is conserned with what occurs after the application has been deployed and is being used by an actual end user.}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\textbf{M1}] Change difficulty. \\
        \textit{\small{The user is able to choose between three difficulty levels: easy; medium; and hard. Ocean space is determined by these, where the easy setting gives the largest ocean space, and hard setting gives the smallest ocean space. If the ocean space is small, the probability to get hit increases and vice versa. The opposing players' difficulty settings are asymmetrical, such that a player playing with the difficulty setting \emph{easy}, can play against a player with the difficulty setting \emph{hard}.}}

\section{Usability}
According to Bass, Clements and Kazman, \emph{usability} is concerned about making the the tasks involved in the system as easy to accomplish as possible \cite[p.~90]{pensum}. Below we have identified the following use cases for assuring the usability of LaHAW.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\textbf{U1}] Placing the ships. \\
        \textit{\small{The user should be able to see each of their ships being placed on the ocean.}}
        
        \begin{tabular}{| l | p{7cm} |}

            \hline
            Source & End User \\

            Artifact & System \\
            Environment & Game play \\
            Response & Move ships  \\
            Response measure 	& After positioning the ships, \\ 
            									& the user is able to change these positions, one at a time. \\
