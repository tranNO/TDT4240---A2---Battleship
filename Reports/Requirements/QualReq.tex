\section{Modifiability}
Modifiability in an architectural sense is concerned about the cost of changeÂ \cite{pensum}. Our main approach is mainly concerned with changes made in \emph{design time}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\textbf{M1}] Change difficulty. \\
        \textit{\small{The user is able to choose between three difficulty levels: easy; medium; and hard. Ocean space is determined by these, where the easy setting gives the largest ocean space, and hard setting gives the smallest ocean space. If the ocean space is small, the probability to get hit increases and vice versa. The opposing players' difficulty settings are asymmetrical, such that a player playing with the difficulty setting \emph{easy}, can play against a player with the difficulty setting \emph{hard}.}}

            Response measure & 10 hours to modify  \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
        
        \item[\textbf{M2}] Set player color. \\
        \textit{\small{The user should be able to change the color of their player color, i.e. the colors of their ships and other UI elements.}}
        
        \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}

\section{Usability}
According to Bass, Clements and Kazman, \emph{usability} is concerned about making the the tasks involved in the system as easy to accomplish as possible \cite[p.~90]{pensum}. Below we have identified the following use cases for assuring the usability of LaHAW.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\textbf{U1}] Placing the ships. \\
        \textit{\small{The user should be able to see each of their ships being placed on the ocean.}}
        
        \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
            \hline
            \rowcolor[gray]{0.8}
            \textbf{Portion of scenario} & \textbf{Values} \\
            \hline
            Source & End User \\
            Stimulus & Change position of the ships \\
            Artifact & System \\
            Environment & Game play \\
            Response & Move ships  \\
            Response measure & After positioning the ships, the user is able to change these positions, one at a time. \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}

        \item[\textbf{U2}] Player name and color saved. \\
        \textit{\small{The player name and color will be saved at start for later use in the game.}}
        
        \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
            \hline

            Response & Support efficient use \\
            Response measure & Reduce task time \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
        
        \item[\textbf{U5}] The game should show game hints whereever appropriate. \\
        \textit{\small{The user gets well-founded recommendations or tips during game play, in order to increase confidence.}}
        
        \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
