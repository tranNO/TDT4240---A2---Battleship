\chapter{Functional Requirements}
% What is functional requirement?
The Functional Requirements tells what function the system shall have.  
% What is priority?
Each of the requirements are prioritised according to how important they are for the project as a whole with a three step scale.

\begin{itemize}
    \item{H (high)}
    \item{M (medium)}
    \item{L (low)}
\end{itemize}

For a small project such as this, we feel that the three step scale gives us enough data for decisons without sacrificing too much fidelity. While the gap between M and H is fairly large, we have no need for the ability to differentiate between a 76 and 77 (on a 1-100 scale).

In addition to these, the requirements will also be prioritised according to how hard the requirements are to fulfill. These priorities will use the same L-M-H scale as descibed above.

What you then end up with is a way to perform a \emph{cost/benefit} analysis for each of the requirements. A requirement that is hard to implement properly, but is of little importance to the project as a whole could be dropped in benefit for a more important one (or a less difficult one), if time and/or costs involved are deemed to be to large.
