\chapter{Introduction}
This document contains the requirements for an Android game called 'Large and Heavily Armored Warships or LaHAW' , to be created by Trond Kjetil Bremnes, Marius Glittum, Alexander Perry and Even Stene. The purpose of the creation of the game is to train ourselves in use of \emph{Commercial Of The Shelf} (COTS) software, as well as architechtural design.

\section{The game}
\textsc{Large and Heavily Armored Warships (LaHAW)} is based on the popular Battleships\cite{battleship} game, a game where the objective of the game is to sink enemy ships, while conceiling the positions of ones own ships. The main game screen is based on an ocean space with multiple tiles (like a grid), where each tile represents a coordinate on the player's ocean space. A ship can span several tiles, in the x and y direction (or it could use just one tile).
