\chapter{Introduction}
This document contains the requirements for an Android game called 'Large and Heavily Armoured Warships' (LaHAW), to be created by Trond Kjetil Bremnes, Marius Glittum, Alexander Perry, Even Stene, Elisabeth Solheim and Trond Klakken. The purpose of creating this game is to train ourselves in the use of \emph{Commercial Of The Shelf} (COTS) software and planning and implementation of architectural and design patterns.




\section{The game}
\textsc{Large and Heavily Armoured Warships (LaHAW)} is based on the popular Battleships\cite{battleship} game, a game where the objective of the game is to sink enemy ships, while concealing the positions of ones own ships. The main game screen is an ocean space with multiple tiles (like a grid), where each tile represents a coordinate on the player's ocean space. A ship can span several tiles, in the x and y direction (or it could use just one tile).

\section{Goals}
The goals of this project is to create a playable prototype of the game discussed above. The game itself is however not the main goal of this project, but rather the process used in realising it as well as the architectural implementation of the application code.



\section{Report structure}

All functional requirements for the game is discussed in \ref{cha:funcreq}, followed by our the quality requirements in chapter \ref{cha:qualreq}.
The different commercial off-the-shelf components that has been utilised in realising the application is discussed in further detail in chapter \ref{cha:cots}.
Chapter \ref{cha:issues} lists various potential issues and problems that we think can arise in the course of the project.
Lastly, this document will list the different revisions that it has been through during the development of the application. This revision history is found in chapter \ref{cha:changes}.
