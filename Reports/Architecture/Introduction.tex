\chapter{Introduction}
This document will provide a documentation of the architecture for \textsc{Large and Heavily Armored Warships} (LaHAW), a game developed for Android. The game is developed as a part of the TDT4240 course.
LaHAW is a remake of the classical 'Battleship' game\cite{battleship}. Battleship is a guessing game situated on an ocean space grid. Players place their boats on selected tiles and should then try to guess where the opponent
have placed his boats. A correct guess is effectively noted as a 'hit'. The game ends when a player has hit all opposing ships.

This document will focus on architectural design choices and how we satisfy the quality requirements set.
Using the IEEE 1471 standard for architectural descriptions of software-intensive systems\cite{IEEE1471} we describe architectural tactics and patterns based on the defined architectural drivers and stakeholders. A description of the 4+1 architectural viewpoint\cite{4+1} and a rationale for our chosen solution is also provided, and how quality and functional requirements influence the choice of architecture.

Patterns used for the realization of LaHAW is Model-View-Controller as an architectural pattern; and Singleton, Observer and State as design patterns. This document will detail the reasoning behind these choises.
