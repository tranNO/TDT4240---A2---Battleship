\chapter{Architectural Viewpoint}
\label{cha:architectural_viewpoint}
For this project we have chosen to make use of the \emph{4+1 architectural view model} to describe the system as needed by the different stakeholders. As each of the different stakeholder groups has different needs that need to be fulfilled by the documentation they need to have a tailored version. As described in chapter \ref{cha:stakeholders}, the main stakeholders identified for this project is the \emph{end user}, the \emph{developers}, the \emph{ATAM evaluator} and the \emph{course staff}.

% Mer rasjonalisering?

We have put most emphasis on the \emph{logic}, \emph{development} and \emph{process} views, as we feel these are the most relevant, and to limit the scope of the project.


    \section{Logic View}
    \textbf{Purpose:} The Logic View decomposes the functional requirements into different classes and show the relationship between these requirements. This in order to showcase the functionality that the system provides to the end user(s).    
    
    \noindent\textbf{Stakeholders:} Course staff, ATAM evaluators and Developers.

    \section{Development view}
    \textbf{Purpose:} The development view illustrates how the different parts of the system looks a developers perspective. Different parts of the system is divided into layers. This view supports delegation of requirements to developers, as well as the possibility to monitor project progress.
    
    \noindent\textbf{Stakeholders:} Course staff, ATAM evaluators and Developers.
    
    % \noindent\textbf{Quality attributes:} Maintainability, portability.
    

    \section{Process view}
    \noindent\textbf{Purpose:} The process view illustrates how different tasks are combined. Here we evaluate performance, availability requirements, system integrity and fault tolerance.
    The process view can specify which thread of control executes operations in the classes identified in the logic view. 

    \noindent\textbf{Stakeholders:} Users, Course staff, ATAM evaluators and Developers.
