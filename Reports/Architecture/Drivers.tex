\chapter{Architectural drivers}
The architectural drivers are the major quality attributes which influences the architecture of the system, and in turn the architectural tactics for the system\cite{pensum}
Architectural focuses on keeping complexity as low as possible, that is avoid unnecessary complexity. 
Business qualities are non-Software System Qualities that influence other quality attributes, we have identified the following business qualities:

\section{Short time to market}
The product needs to be finished and deliverable by the end of the course duration. This means that the product needs to be quick and easy to develop. 

\section{Developer lack of experience}
The project will be developed without prior knowledge or experience with the AndEngine framework\cite{andengine}. For the project to be successful, we will create a base with critical functionality and then extend this with remaining time.

\section{Market}
The game will be targeted at both youth and adults. The game will be used on devices with fairly small screens ranging from 3 to 5 inches, and so the system needs to be easy to understand and use. 
Usability is a primary focus. For a game to be addictive and fun, it needs to be intuitive.

\section{Portability}
If the product development reaches release status, not only can we put the game on the Android Market, but future development could include a conversion to iOS for market expansion. 
This would add a greater crowd and possibly more sales.
