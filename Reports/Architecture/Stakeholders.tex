\chapter{Stakeholders}
For this project, the following stakeholders has been identified:

    \section{End user}
    The end user of this software will be the players of the game. To make the game appeal to these:
    Playability: How easy the game is to understand and play. This means that instructions should be easy to read and understand. 
    Modifiability: Customizing the players name and the color of ships. 
    
    \section{Developer}
    Buildability: The product needs to be finished within a short time period.
    Modifiability: The product should be easy to extend.
    Testability: The product should be easy to test and verify
    
    \section{ATAM evaluator}
    Reviewability: Well written documentation should be used as the basis for an architectural review. Evaluators want the system to be as easy to test as possible, to ensure that all features can be tested. Good testability
    will therefore result in less work for the testers, and in turn a lower cost.

    \section{Course staff}
    Reviewability: The course staff will evaluate our final product according to certain criteria like how good our documentation is, how easy it is to read and how easy it is to setup and run our product.
