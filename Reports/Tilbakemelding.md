# Requirement Document

## Front Page
Front Page should include group number, cots, group members, project name and quality attributes, please add the missing point(s).

*DONE*

## Introduction
Introduction should cover a brief description of the project (goals, the course, and etc.) and the topic of each chapter, please improve the introduction with adding missing points.

## Functional Requirements
Better to have an overall description of the functional requirements.
Define a priority for each item.
Priorities of the requirements should be explained. E.g. What does "high" (or similar) mean?

## Quality Requirements	  
M1-M3 response time is way too long. Are you sure you need 10 hours to change ship colors? Even adding a settings page for it should not cost that time.
 
M2 says set player color is a modifiability senario, but U2 says player can set color and player name. Is it an implemented feature or modifiability senario?
 
U1 is just a mandatory functional requirement, not "usability" requirement which means how easy is it to use your system.

U5 response measure should be for example "User can play the game without problem regarding to game control in 1 hour".

## COTS
When describing a COTS, please brief the services it provides and the constraints it brings.

Some COTS are described too rough, please elaborate the COTS used.

Android software system needs to be described.

## Stakeholders and Concerns
Development group should have "Grade" as a major concern.

## Selection of Architectural Viewpoints
Views should be an individual chapter, do not present them in this chapter.
 	
Class diagram does not use correct notation.

Views should be introduced with text besides the diagrams.

Development View is too rough to guide the development.

## Rationale
Missing!

## Issues
