## Quality Requirements	  
M1-M3 response time is way too long. Are you sure you need 10 hours to change ship colors? Even adding a settings page for it should not cost that time.
 
M2 says set player color is a modifiability scenario, but U2 says player can set color and player name. Is it an implemented feature or modifiability senario?
 

U1 is just a mandatory functional requirement, not "usability" requirement which means how easy is it to use your system.

U5 response measure should be for example "User can play the game without problem regarding to game control in 1 hour".
